# Cross-Platform Testing Guide

This document outlines the testing procedures to verify that all `jan-cli` and `Makefile` commands work correctly on both Windows and Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS).

## Overview

The Jan Server project provides dual interfaces for managing the development workflow:
- **jan-cli** - Go-based command-line tool with auto-rebuild wrappers
- **Makefile** - Build automation with platform-specific branches

Both systems must work reliably on:
- **Windows** - PowerShell 5.1+
- **Linux** - Bash shell
- **macOS** - Bash/Zsh shell

## Testing Checklist

### 🔄 Unix Testing

You have **three ways** to test on Unix systems (Linux/macOS):

#### Option 1: Automated CI/CD Testing (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tests on:
- **Ubuntu** (latest)
- **macOS** (latest)
- **Windows** (latest)

The workflow is triggered on:
- Pull requests that modify `cmd/jan-cli/**`, `Makefile`, or wrapper scripts
- Pushes to `main` or `feat/v2-config-refactor` branches

**Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/cross-platform-test.yml`

To view test results:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Select **Cross-Platform Testing** workflow
4. View the latest run

#### Option 2: Local Automated Test Script

Run the comprehensive test script on any Unix system:

```bash
# Make the test script executable (first time only)
chmod +x tests/test-unix.sh

# Run all tests
./tests/test-unix.sh
```

This script tests:
- All jan-cli commands (help, dev setup, config commands, service list, swagger)
- All Makefile targets (setup, config-generate, build targets, clean-build)
- File creation verification
- Auto-rebuild detection
- Binary generation verification

The script provides:
- ✓ Pass/fail status for each test
- Color-coded output (green for pass, red for fail)
- Detailed summary with system information
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure (CI/CD friendly)

#### Option 3: Manual Testing

Test individual commands on Linux/macOS:

```bash
# Basic jan-cli commands
./jan-cli.sh --help
./jan-cli.sh dev setup
./jan-cli.sh config generate
./jan-cli.sh config show
./jan-cli.sh service list
./jan-cli.sh swagger generate --service llm-api
./jan-cli.sh setup-and-run

# Makefile targets
make quickstart
make setup
make check-deps
make config-generate
make build-llm-api
make clean-build
make up-full
make health-check
```

## Platform-Specific Fixes Applied

### 1. Makefile Build Targets

**Issue**: Build commands using `cd services/llm-api && go build` didn't work properly on Windows.

**Fix**: Added platform-specific branches with correct path separators:

```makefile
build-llm-api:
	@echo "Building LLM API..."
ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
	@cd services\llm-api && go build -o bin\llm-api.exe .\cmd\server
else
	@cd services/llm-api && go build -o bin/llm-api ./cmd/server
endif
	@echo " LLM API built: services/llm-api/bin/llm-api"
```

### 2. Makefile Clean Target

**Issue**: `rm -rf` command doesn't exist on Windows.

**Fix**: Added Windows-specific directory removal:

```makefile
clean-build:
	@echo "Cleaning build artifacts..."
ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
	@if exist services\llm-api\bin rd /s /q services\llm-api\bin >nul 2>&1
	@if exist services\media-api\bin rd /s /q services\media-api\bin >nul 2>&1
	@if exist services\mcp-tools\bin rd /s /q services\mcp-tools\bin >nul 2>&1
else
	@rm -rf services/llm-api/bin
	@rm -rf services/media-api/bin
	@rm -rf services/mcp-tools/bin
endif
	@echo " Build artifacts cleaned"
```

### 3. Auto-Rebuild Wrapper Scripts

**Issue**: jan-cli wrappers only checked `main.go`, missing changes in other source files.

**Fix**: Updated both `jan-cli.ps1` and `jan-cli.sh` to check **all** `*.go` files:

**Windows (jan-cli.ps1)**:
```powershell
# Check if any .go file is newer than the binary
$needsRebuild = $false
Get-ChildItem -Path $CLIDir -Filter "*.go" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.LastWriteTime -gt $binaryTime) {
        $needsRebuild = $true
    }
}
```

**Unix (jan-cli.sh)**:
```bash
# Check if any .go file is newer than the binary
if find "$CLI_DIR" -name "*.go" -type f -newer "$BINARY" | grep -q .; then
    echo "Detected changes in source files. Rebuilding..."
    # rebuild logic
fi
```

### 4. Cross-Platform Sleep Commands

**Issue**: Interactive setup needs to pause for user review. PowerShell uses `Start-Sleep`, Unix uses `sleep`.

**Fix**: Implemented in `cmd/jan-cli/cmd_setup.go`:

```go
func execCommandSilent(name string, args ...string) error {
	cmd := exec.Command(name, args...)
	return cmd.Run() // Silent execution, no output
}

// Platform-specific sleep
if isWindows() {
	execCommandSilent("powershell", "-Command", "Start-Sleep -Seconds 2")
} else {
	execCommandSilent("sleep", "2")
}
```

## Known Limitations

### Windows-Specific

1. **Make Output Suppression**: Some `make` commands show only quoted strings due to Windows shell redirection differences. Functionality works correctly despite cosmetic output issues.

2. **Path Separators**: Windows uses backslashes (`\`) in paths. The Makefile uses `ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)` branches to handle this.

3. **Binary Extensions**: Windows executables need `.exe` extension. Build targets account for this.

### Unix-Specific

1. **Bash Dependency**: The `jan-cli.sh` wrapper requires Bash shell (not tested on other shells like Fish or Tcsh).

2. **Execute Permissions**: The `jan-cli.sh` script may need `chmod +x jan-cli.sh` on first use.

## Best Practices for Cross-Platform Development

### 1. Use jan-cli for Complex Operations

Prefer `jan-cli` commands over `Makefile` for operations involving:
- File system operations (creating directories, copying files)
- Interactive prompts
- Complex conditional logic

**Why**: Go code is inherently cross-platform, while Makefile syntax requires platform-specific branches.

### 2. Use Makefile for Docker Compose Operations

Prefer `Makefile` for:
- Docker Compose commands (`up-infra`, `up-full`, `down`)
- Service orchestration
- Testing with Newman
- Health checks

**Why**: These operations are already cross-platform via Docker CLI.

### 3. Test Both Systems

When adding new functionality:
1. Test on Windows PowerShell first (most restrictive)
2. Test on Linux/macOS
3. Verify wrapper scripts auto-rebuild correctly
4. Check that both `jan-cli` and `make` interfaces work

### 4. Avoid Shell-Specific Syntax

**Don't**:
```makefile
@cd services/llm-api && go build  # Fails on Windows Make
@rm -rf bin  # Fails on Windows
```

**Do**:
```makefile
ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
	@cd services\llm-api && go build
	@if exist bin rd /s /q bin
else
	@cd services/llm-api && go build
	@rm -rf bin
endif
```

## Testing Scripts

### Unix/Linux/macOS Automated Test Script

**Location**: `tests/test-unix.sh`

This comprehensive test script is included in the repository and tests all critical functionality:

```bash
# Make executable (first time only)
chmod +x tests/test-unix.sh

# Run all tests
./tests/test-unix.sh
```

**Features**:
- 16 comprehensive tests covering jan-cli and Makefile commands
- Color-coded output (green = pass, red = fail, yellow = warning)
- Detailed test results with system information
- Automatic prerequisite checking (Go, Docker, Make)
- Binary verification after builds
- Configuration file verification
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure (CI/CD compatible)

### Windows PowerShell Test Script

Save as `test-windows.ps1`:

```powershell
# Jan Server Cross-Platform Test Script (Windows)
Write-Host "Testing jan-cli commands..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Test basic commands
Write-Host "`n1. Testing jan-cli --help" -ForegroundColor Yellow
.\jan-cli.ps1 --help

Write-Host "`n2. Testing jan-cli dev setup" -ForegroundColor Yellow
.\jan-cli.ps1 dev setup

Write-Host "`n3. Testing jan-cli config generate" -ForegroundColor Yellow
.\jan-cli.ps1 config generate

Write-Host "`n4. Testing jan-cli config show" -ForegroundColor Yellow
.\jan-cli.ps1 config show

Write-Host "`n5. Testing jan-cli service list" -ForegroundColor Yellow
.\jan-cli.ps1 service list

Write-Host "`n6. Testing make build-llm-api" -ForegroundColor Yellow
make build-llm-api

Write-Host "`n7. Testing make clean-build" -ForegroundColor Yellow
make clean-build

Write-Host "`nAll tests completed!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

**Location**: `.github/workflows/cross-platform-test.yml`

The repository includes a comprehensive CI/CD workflow that automatically tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners.

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests modifying jan-cli, Makefile, or wrapper scripts
- Pushes to `main` or `feat/v2-config-refactor` branches

**What it tests**:
- All jan-cli commands on all three platforms
- All Makefile targets on all three platforms
- Binary creation and cleanup
- Config file generation and validation
- Auto-rebuild detection
- Platform-specific compatibility

**Viewing results**:
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Select the **Cross-Platform Testing** workflow
4. View test results for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows

The workflow provides a summary job that reports overall pass/fail status across all platforms.

## Quick Start for Unix Testing

If you're on a Unix system and want to quickly verify everything works:

```bash
# Option 1: Run automated test suite (recommended)
chmod +x tests/test-unix.sh
./tests/test-unix.sh

# Option 2: Quick manual verification
chmod +x jan-cli.sh
./jan-cli.sh dev setup
./jan-cli.sh config generate
make build-llm-api
make clean-build
```

## Continuous Integration

### Setting Up GitHub Actions

The cross-platform testing workflow is already configured in `.github/workflows/cross-platform-test.yml`. It will automatically run on:

1. **Pull Requests**: When you create a PR that modifies jan-cli or related files
2. **Push to Main**: When changes are merged to the main branch
3. **Push to Feature Branch**: When pushing to `feat/v2-config-refactor`

No additional setup is required - just push your changes and GitHub Actions will automatically test on all three platforms.

### Local Pre-Push Testing

Before pushing changes, you can run local tests:

**On Unix/Linux/macOS**:
```bash
./tests/test-unix.sh
```

**On Windows**:
```powershell
.\tests\test-windows.ps1  # (if you create this file)
```

This helps catch issues before they reach CI/CD.

### Unix/Linux/macOS Test Script

Save as `test-unix.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# See tests/test-unix.sh for the complete implementation
# This script is already included in the repository at tests/test-unix.sh
```

**The complete automated test script is available at `tests/test-unix.sh` in the repository.**

## Reporting Issues

When reporting cross-platform issues, please include:

1. **Platform**: Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS Sonoma, etc.
2. **Shell**: PowerShell 5.1/7+, Bash 4+, Zsh, etc.
3. **Command**: Exact command that failed
4. **Error Output**: Full error message
5. **Expected Behavior**: What should have happened
6. **Workaround**: Any temporary solution found

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. ✅ **Automated CI Testing** - **COMPLETED**: Added GitHub Actions workflows to test on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners automatically.

2. ✅ **Unix Testing Script** - **COMPLETED**: Created `tests/test-unix.sh` with comprehensive automated testing.

3. **Integration Tests**: Create automated tests that run full workflows (setup → build → deploy → test → teardown).

4. **Platform Detection in Go**: Move more platform-specific logic from Makefile into Go code for better maintainability.

5. **Windows Git Bash Support**: Test and document compatibility with Git Bash on Windows.

## Summary

### ✅ What Works
