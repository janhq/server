## Common Tasks

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Setup development environment (.env + docker/.env)
make setup

# 2. Start everything in Docker
make up-full

# 3. Switch a service to native mode (optional)
docker compose stop llm-api
./jan-cli.sh dev run llm-api   # macOS/Linux
.\jan-cli.ps1 dev run llm-api  # Windows

# 4. Run automated tests
make test-all                  # jan-cli api-test integration suites
go test ./services/llm-api/... # Unit tests from source
```

Use [Development Guide](development.md) for the end-to-end workflow and [Dev-Full Mode](dev-full-mode.md) when you need host-native debugging.

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Integration tests (runs all Postman collections)
make test-all

# Specific test suites
make test-auth
make test-conversations
make test-mcp

# Unit tests from source
go test ./...
```

See [Testing Guide](testing.md) for details.

### Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Start monitoring stack
make monitor-up

# Access dashboards
# - Grafana: http://localhost:3331
# - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# - Jaeger: http://localhost:16686

# View logs
make monitor-logs
```

See [Monitoring Guide](monitoring.md) for details.
