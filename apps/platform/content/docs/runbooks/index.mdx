# Runbooks

On-call playbooks for operating Jan Server. Use these when responding to incidents or performing operational tasks that must be repeatable and low-risk.

## Available runbooks
- [Monitoring](./monitoring) - Health checks, dashboards, alerts, tracing, and log capture steps.

## When to use guides vs runbooks
- **Runbooks**: Pager/on-call situations, incident response, repetitive operational procedures.
- **Guides**: Learning, setup, and exploratory workflows (see `../guides/`).

## Contributing
- Keep steps concise and command-first.
- Include prerequisites (access, permissions, tools).
- Add rollback/verification steps and expected outcomes.
- Link back to the relevant guide for deeper context.
