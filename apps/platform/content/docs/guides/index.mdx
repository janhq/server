# 3. Switch a service to native mode (optional)
docker compose stop llm-api
./jan-cli.sh dev run llm-api   # macOS/Linux
.\jan-cli.ps1 dev run llm-api  # Windows

# 4. Run automated tests
make test-all                  # jan-cli api-test integration suites
go test ./services/llm-api/... # Unit tests from source
```

Use [Development Guide](./development) for the complete workflow including full Docker, dev-full (hybrid), and native execution modes.

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Integration tests (runs all Postman collections)
make test-all

# Specific test suites

make test-conversations
make test-mcp

# Unit tests from source
go test ./...
```

See [Testing Guide](./testing) for details.
