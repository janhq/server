# Backward compatibility

Jan is committed to providing stability to API users by avoiding breaking changes in major API
versions whenever reasonably possible. This includes:

- The REST API (currently `v1`)
- OpenAI SDK compatibility
- Model families

> **Model prompting behavior between snapshots is subject to change.**

> Model outputs are by their nature variable, so expect changes in prompting and model behavior
> between snapshots. For example, if you moved from one model or snapshot version to another, the
> same `system` or `user` messages could function differently between versions. The best way to
> ensure consistent prompting behavior and model output is to use pinned model versions, and to
> implement evals for your applications.

## Backwards-compatible API changes:

- Adding new resources (URLs) to the REST API
- Adding new optional API parameters
- Adding new properties to JSON response objects or event data
- Changing the order of properties in a JSON response object
- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, like resource identifiers and UUIDs
- Adding new event types (in either streaming or the Realtime API)

See the [changelog](https://platform.jan.ai/docs/guides/changelog) for a list of
backwards-compatible changes and rare breaking changes.
