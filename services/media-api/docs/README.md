# Media API Documentation

- `NEW_SERVICE_GUIDE.md`: onboarding + migration checklist for new services integrating with media-api.
- `swagger/`: autogenerated OpenAPI schema (`make swagger` to refresh).
- `.env.template`: sample configuration for local development (S3 credentials, API key, etc.) — copy via `make env-create`.

Add service-specific ADRs, API docs, and runbooks inside this folder as the service evolves.
